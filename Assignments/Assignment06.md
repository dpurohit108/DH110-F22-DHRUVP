# Assignment 06: Interface Design

Dhruv Purohit | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to redesign the current [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website to make it more accessible for the ideal and most common user. In doing so, the aim is to make it easier for the user to find relevant information on sustainability in a quick and efficient manner. Currently, the site is difficult to navigate and disorganized. Additionally, information on the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals is difficult to locate with a few clicks. Therefore, one of the main goals is to make it easy for the user to find information on these goals and what they are. 

The interface design process for this website includes the following process: 

1. Grid Design & Layout (aligning all items with a grid)
2. Typographic Design & Variations (designing & varying the text fonts)
3. Shape Design & Variations (designing & varying the shape of boxes/buttons)
4. Color Design & Variations (designing & varying the color options, specifically a light and dark mode)
5. Accessibility CHeck (check on color contrast)
6. User Impression Testing
7. Revisions from user feedback
8. Final Interface Design

The purpose of the interface design process is to iterate through various design elements that the user may see on a specific website or app, particularly from an aesthetic and functional view. Interface design focuses on anticipating what the user needs and will do as they navigate the website/app. The goal of this process is to design an interface that is (1) appealing to the user, (2) easy to navigate, and (3) engages the user in an effective and efficient way.

## Impression Test
The user I used for the impression test preferred that I use their direct quotations as part of the summary. As they viewed my screen designs, I took note of the comments that were made (both positive and negative). I asked the user to give their impression of the current design choice (above). Following their initial, quick impression of my design, I asked them some further questions about the design to ensure that they were able to tell me things they liked and disliked. I then guided them through the various design options and asked them to point out what the liked/disliked. 

User quotes: 

* "I think each button that states 'goal 1, 2, 3 etc..' could have an indicator, like an arrow, that encourages the user to click on the button. 
* "The color choice is dynamic and catches my eye"
* "Adding some sort of symbol next to the newsletter sign-up and additional buttons near the bottom would be nice"
* "The design is very symmetrical"
* "The page is filled with blue buttons, however, the black buttons stand out"
* "The page is lacking clear direction on what they should when they reach the page"

Overall, the user found my interface design pretty good and liked the design choices I made. 

## Accessibility Check
A color contrast accessibility test was run on the various color contrasts on the interface design using the [Spark](https://www.getstark.co/) plugin. The results on the various contrasts can be seen in the screenshots below.

  <img src="access3.png" alt="Color accessibility" width="200px"/>
  <img src="access4.png" alt="Color accessibility" width="200px"/>
</p>

All of the text passed the WCAG 2.0 AA level. Three of the four tests did not pass the AAA level, however, since all the text falls into the "large text" category and since we are primarily concerned with the AA test, I came to the conclusion that the chosen colors were accessible. 

## Revisions
Following the comments from the impression test, the following revisions were made to the [current design choice](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment06.md#current-design-choice) that I had previously selected.
