# Protecting & Promoting Sustainable Use of Ecosystems, Forests, Compating Desertification, Halting/Reversing Land Degradation, and Halting Biodiversity Loss

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Dhruv Purohit | DH110 | Fall 2022

### About the project

The United Nations (UN) has a list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, one of which is entitled "Life on Land" (Goal 15). According to the UN, the objective of this goal is to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." For this project, I will be focusing on analyzing user interface and design aspects that would enable people all over the world to learn more and become more aware of this particular sustainability goal.  


### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) 

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, and give timely and appropriate feedback |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | The design should be familiar to the user, not something too difficult to understand |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | The design has functions that allows users to undo or redo their actions |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | The design and use of words is streamlines and easy to understand |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Remove error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets/confirmation for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize the user's memory load by giving them suggestions and context to what they have to do |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide numerous ways to perform a task and include shortcuts to increase accessibility |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide relevant content/features and keep things to a minimum |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Aid users in telling them any issues/problems |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra resources, such as a search, chat, or guide, to help them complete tasks |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.
