## Design Challenge (Research Goal & Requirements)

How can we make learning about preserving/protecting ecosystems and environments accessible, orgainzed, and effective so people can make informed decisions and choices on a regular basis? 

Given the issues addressed through the heuristic evaulation in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md) and the pilot usability test in [Assignment 2](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment02.md), the goal of the redesign of the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) is to make it more accessible and orgainzed for its target users to be able to educate themselves on issues pertaining to protecting ecosystems and promoting.  

This project aims to better support and inform users on environmental protections topics, particularly pertaining to the sustainable goals outlined by the United Nations. There are plenty of sources online pertaining to environmental justice, protecting ecosystems, climate change, and fighting unjust practices toward our environment. While there are countless websites, resources, and opinions that exist on this matter, it is critical to observe that aspects/elements are most important to use in order to better design/redesign new and existing sites to deliver on content that is interesting, appealing, and useful to the user. Some limitations that may exist are solutions that are too complex for the user to really understand or apply to their day to day life. There's a lot of data thrown around on this topic, and it can get quite confusing for some people. Making points very clear and simple to understand are critical in order to properly engage with the user. Additionally, improving web functionality and design can make users more attracted to learn about the topic and spend more time engaging with the topic. 

## Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users?
The target user group for this site are younger users who have completed their higher education and are working in industry. The topic and site are more likely to get more web traffic and interest from this group of users. For this reason, and the purpose of this contextual inquiry, the target age group will be people in the age range of 25-35, specifically young, working adults.

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
The user would engage with the activities in the setting of their home or a place comfortable for the user and activity leader to be together. There are no specific conditions that the user should be under. However, they should allocate adequate time to complete all activities in order to gain valuable and accurate data. 

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
In order to complete the activity, the users would simply need to be knowledgeable about how to navigate a computer/webpage and have some interest in the topic. No prior experience or engagement with any specific site is necessary in order to complete the activities. Users would be asked a variety of tasks, however, these tasks require them to navigate the web like they do on a daily basis. 

## Research Methods

As a means to gain more insight into how to improve the redesign of the website, I conducted a contextual inquiry. This allowed me to learn more about how users interacted with the topic and activities, and how their actions can be used to improve the UN site. The research methods involved in this process include active and participatory interactions. For my inquiry, the focused participation of the user is critical. Additionally, adding active interactions is likely to increase the amount of observable data throughout the activities. The interview would be conducted in-person, and an audio recording (accompanied by a transcription) would be recorded through [otter.ai](https://otter.ai/). 

### Inquiry Process & User Activities

The interview process included the following steps: 

1. Introductory/Background Questions: Asked to get a good understanding of the user's background and context with the topic.
2. Observations During Activities: Used to observe the user in their natural web search setting and to document findings. 
3. Follow-up and Closing Questions: Ask the user about how they felt after the activities and get final thoughts.

## Reflections

### Key Insights from the Interview & Data

:bulb: It's important to see how people get their information, as they may not access the website all the time. However, having a clear newsletter sign up can help deliver information when people look for it in their inbox versus a constant search.

* "I usually just rely on information shared through my workplace or other notifications other than that I don't really search for information." (6:16)

:bulb: Information overload does not work with this topic. The user expressed frustration over the amount of information on certain sites. 

* "I think some look like they're just a whole bunch of information overload and they're not as inviting to read others are organized in a way that just makes it easier to digest this information." (11:56)

* "What stands out is they include pictures that's a font size that's easy to read and and they are sort of bite size, digestible pieces of information. So just easily digestible." (12:31)

:bulb: The initial items that pop up on a search or website are critical as that's what people read first. At times, that may be the only thing they read, so ensuring it is something that captures the user's attention is important.

* "What stood out to me is how easily and quickly you can find out whether a company has sustainable practices or not." (20:34)

### Personal Reflections & Lessons Learned
Given the issues that have arisen through previous analysis, I was already starting to see what areas of the site needed re-design and improvements. However, this contextual inquiry provided me with even more detail as to what to look for in an ideal site and how to further improve the redesign of the UN Environment Programme website. I had a couple of big "aha" moments throughout the interview which really added to my list of improvements for the site. The items/topics that stood out to me were (1) the presentation of information on sites experienced by the user, (2) the vast amount of information that the user found interesting, and (3) how quickly a user was willing to integrate a change into their life, but it all depended on the clarity and simplicity of the information they read/received. In terms of what the user was drawn to, they emphasized clear images/pictures and data. This was in linie with the comments on information overload and how clear and concise delivery of information is very important. Another important aspect that the user highlighted is how they can stay in the know on this information without having to constantly search for updates. They stated that having a concise and informative newsletter would be effective. This allows for the user to remain engaged without having to put in too much effort on their part. 

Overall, the contextual inquiry went well, however, there were some lessons learned that could improve the process and data collection in the future. First off, while I asked the user to speak a lot of their thoughts aloud, they did not do so at all times. Additionally, certain tasks went in a slightly different direction than I had planned, despite my guided instructions. I also learned to have to be ready with responses, and even questions at times, on the fly. While I had the script for the majority of the interview, there were points at which I had to either respond to questions or even come up with better follow up questions based off of the user's response. Lastly, I think it's important to have alternative plans for the cases where the user doesn't interact the best with the activities or questions. This *did not* happen in my case, but I see how it could be an issue with certain people.
