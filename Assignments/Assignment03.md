## Project Description

#### Design Challenge (Research Goal & Requirements)

How can we make learning about preserving/protecting ecosystems and environments accessible, orgainzed, and effective so people can make imformed decisions and choices on a regular basis? 

Given the issues addressed through the heuristic evaulation in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md) and the pilot usability test in [Assignment 2](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment02.md), the goal of the redesign of the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) is to make it more accessible and orgainzed for its target users.
