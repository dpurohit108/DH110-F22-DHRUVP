## Design Challenge (Research Goal & Requirements)

How can we make learning about preserving/protecting ecosystems and environments accessible, orgainzed, and effective so people can make informed decisions and choices on a regular basis? 

Given the issues addressed through the heuristic evaulation in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md) and the pilot usability test in [Assignment 2](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment02.md), the goal of the redesign of the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) is to make it more accessible and orgainzed for its target users to be able to educate themselves on issues pertaining to protecting ecosystems and promoting.  

This project aims to better support and inform users on environmental protections topics, particularly pertaining to the sustainable goals outlined by the United Nations. There are plenty of sources online pertaining to environmental justice, protecting ecosystems, climate change, and fighting unjust practices toward our environment. While there are countless websites, resources, and opinions that exist on this matter, it is critical to observe that aspects/elements are most important to use in order to better design/redesign new and existing sites to deliver on content that is interesting, appealing, and useful to the user. Some limitations that may exist are solutions that are too complex for the user to really understand or apply to their day to day life. There's a lot of data thrown around on this topic, and it can get quite confusing for some people. Making points very clear and simple to understand are critical in order to properly engage with the user. Additionally, improving web functionality and design can make users more attracted to learn about the topic and spend more time engaging with the topic. 

## Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users?
The target user group for this site are younger users who have completed their higher education and are working in industry. The topic and site are more likely to get more web traffic and interest from this group of users. For this reason, and the purpose of this contextual inquiry, the target age group will be people in the age range of 25-35, specifically young, working adults.

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
The user would engage with the activities in the setting of their home or a place comfortable for the user and activity leader to be together. There are no specific conditions that the user should be under. However, they should allocate adequate time to complete all activities in order to gain valuable and accurate data. 

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
In order to complete the activity, the users would simply need to be knowledgeable about how to navigate a computer/webpage and have some interest in the topic. No prior experience or engagement with any specific site is necessary in order to complete the activities. Users would be asked a variety of tasks, however, these tasks require them to navigate the web like they do on a daily basis. 

## Research Methods

As a means to gain more insight into how to improve the redesign of the website, I conducted a contextual inquiry. This allowed me to learn more about how users interacted with the topic and activities, and how their actions can be used to improve the UN site. The research methods involved in this process include active and participatory interactions. For my inquiry, the focused participation of the user is critical. Additionally, adding active interactions is likely to increase the amount of observable data throughout the activities. The interview would be conducted in-person, and an audio recording (accompanied by a transcription) would be recorded through otter.ai. 

### Inquiry Process & User Activities

The interview process included the following steps: 

1. Introductory/Background Questions: Asked to get a good understanding of the user's background and context with the topic.
2. Observations During Activities: Used to observe the user in their natural web search setting and to document findings. 
3. Follow-up and Closing Questions: Ask the user about how they felt after the activities and get final thoughts.

## Reflections

### Key Insights from the Interview & Data

### Personal Reflections & Lessons Learned
Given the issues that have arisen through previous analysis, I was already starting to see what areas of the site needed re-design and improvements.
