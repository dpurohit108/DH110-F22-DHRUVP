### UN Environment Programme - Site Used for UT

[UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/sustainable-development-goals/why-do-sustainable-development-goals-matter/goal-15) is a site that enables users to discover more about UN environmental programs. The website contains lots of information, however, it can be challenging to navigate and unorganized at times.

Previously in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md), a heuristic evaluation was performed on the site to understand where there were issues with the site. Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) were used in this process. Following this initial evaluation, I addressed several usability concerns that needed to be addressed in order to make the website more user friendly and accessible. These concerns were mostly centered around the function of aspects of the site, how users navigate the site, where certain information was located, and aspects of the aesthetic design as well. As I prepared for the pilot UT, I kept all of these issues in mind in order to see if the issues I recognized challenged other users as well.  

## Purpose of UT 
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to better understand and highlight issues in a website/app's interface. While the heuristic evaluation raises certain issues, the UT can be used to (1) confirm the issues outlined previously and (2) bring to light additional issues and challenges the user may face while attempting to complete certain tasks. The UT also allows for a really good user perspective, which brings up additional issues and highlights what works and doesn't work on a website. The user perspective is critical as the website is designed for use by users around the world. If aspects of the website do not fit what the user needs/desires, the website has failed to achieve its goal. The UT process is critical at numerous stages of web development, however, when utilized in the early stages of web development, it can lead to a much more successful and robust final product. 

## About the UT Pilot Process
The purpose of the UT pilot process is to gain insight into how materials and software used for the UT process function and work with the test subject(s). This process was conducted in person, and recorded using zoom, in order to capture the screen and the facial expressions of the subject. Prior to the session, I created a robust questionnaire which included tasks and additional questions on the user's experience and interactions with the site. 

At the beginning of the session, the user was provided with some background into the questionnaire and the process that they were proceeding with. Following a set of background questions and pre-test questions, the user was presented a set of tasks. Given the issues I highlighted in the heuristic evaluation, the tasks were centered around issues I found through my analysis. They included the following: 

Task 1: Suppose you want to learn about the sustainable development goals and the progress being made to achieve them. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on sustainable development goals
* Locate the colorful boxes that are associated with the goals
* Click on one of the goals to view more details
* Locate the page on measuring progress on the goals

Task 2: Suppose you work for a fossil fuel company and are trying to find out more information on what the UN Environment Programme highlights about chemical pollutants. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on chemicals and pollution action
* Find information on the benefits of chemical control
* Find the main contributors to chemical pollution around the world

Task 3: Suppose you are a researcher and want to obtain details on publications and studies. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on publications & data
* Navigate to the "see more" under publications
* Find publications on the topic of sustainable goals

Task 4: Suppose you want to sign up for the newsletter. 
* Navigate to the page to sign up for the newsletter

Following these tasks, the user was presented with a series of post-test questions. These questions aimed to gauge how easy/difficult the website was for the user and how likely they were to perform certain tasks. The test ended with statements to gauge the user's satisfaction with the website (System Usability Scale and Product Reaction Cards). Lastly, a few demographic questions were asked to the user. 

## Materials Used

## Reflection & Findings

Overall, the results from this pilot test were in line with the issues I addressed in the heuristic evaluation. The test went quite smoothly, and the user was able to navigate through the website to attempt to complete all the tasks. While the user was successful at completing 9 of the 11 subtasks, the user pointed out that the most likely task they would complete was the most difficult and time consuming. In the System Usability Scale questions, the user noted that the website functions were not well integrated, that the site lacked consistency, and that the site was cumbersome to use as a whole. In analyzing the results (both in the form of the video/facial expressions/sounds of the voice and the questionnaire results), I can definitely say that the user was frustrated and somewhat lost on numerous occasions throughout the testing process. Additionally, some tasks that should theoretically be quick, took the user quite a long time to perform. The user also pointed out the lack of existence/functionality of a search bar, therefore making it more difficult to search for specific items quickly. The user's actions to attempt to complete the tasks also highlighted the issues with the design and placement of the menu/top bar. This UT process also brought up some additional issues that I didn't emphasize in my heuristic evaluation. While I had mentioned that clicking on certain places/links will lead to the opening of a new tab, I found out that this was much more common across the website and frustrated the user quite a bit. Additionally, I learned that certain areas of the website have some sort of a search function, and others do not. This contributes to the lack of consistency. Lastly, it was very evident through this analysis that every page/area on the website had its own design and layout. This again contributes heavily to the lack of consistency (both functional and aesthetic consistency) across the site. 

Despite all that went well as described above, there is still room for improvement to make the test even more accurate and effective. I could spend more time refining the sub task items for each larger task to make them more sequential and detailed. I think doing this will aid the user in their attempt to complete the task. My user was very good at speaking through the process and revealing their thoughts. However, everyone wonâ€™t do that. Therefore, including more opportunities for users to voice their opinions and thoughts as they are going through the UT process is critical. Additionally, the user should know that they are free to navigate the site a bit during the pre-test questions. While the link to the website was provided, there was no guidance on whether the user should just look at the screenshot (provided in the google form) or spend a little time looking at the site itself. This is an important addition/clarification to make. Lastly, I would improve this test by adding more, well thought out, tasks that targeted additional heuristic issues throughout the site. This would lead to more data on the functionality of additional aspects on the site.
