## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing (UT)

### UN Environment Programme - Site Used for UT

[UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/sustainable-development-goals/why-do-sustainable-development-goals-matter/goal-15) is a site that enables users to discover more about UN environmental programs. The website contains lots of information, however, it can be challenging to navigate and unorganized at times.

Previously in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md), a heuristic evaluation was performed on the site to understand where there were issues with the site. Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) were used in this process. Following this initial evaluation, I addressed several usability concerns that needed to be addressed in order to make the website more user friendly and accessible. These concerns were mostly centered around the function of aspects of the site, how users navigate the site, where certain information was located, and aspects of the aesthetic design as well. As I prepared for the pilot UT, I kept all of these issues in mind in order to see if the issues I recognized challenged other users as well.  

## Purpose of UT 
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to better understand and highlighh issues in a website/app's interface. 

## About the UT Pilot Process
The purpose of the UT pilot process is gain insight into how materials and software used for the UT process function and work with the test subject(s). This process was conducted in person, and recorded using zoom, in order to capture the screen and the facial expressions of the subject
