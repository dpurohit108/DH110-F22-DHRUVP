### UN Environment Programme - Site Used for UT

[UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/sustainable-development-goals/why-do-sustainable-development-goals-matter/goal-15) is a site that enables users to discover more about UN environmental programs. The website contains lots of information, however, it can be challenging to navigate and unorganized at times.

Previously in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md), a heuristic evaluation was performed on the site to understand where there were issues with the site. Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) were used in this process. Following this initial evaluation, I addressed several usability concerns that needed to be addressed in order to make the website more user friendly and accessible. These concerns were mostly centered around the function of aspects of the site, how users navigate the site, where certain information was located, and aspects of the aesthetic design as well. As I prepared for the pilot UT, I kept all of these issues in mind in order to see if the issues I recognized challenged other users as well.  

## Purpose of UT 
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to better understand and highlight issues in a website/app's interface. While the heuristic evaluation raises certain issues, the UT can be used to (1) confirm the issues outlined previously and (2) bring to light additional issues and challenges the user may face while attempting to complete certain tasks. The UT also allows for a really good user perspective, which brings up additional issues and highlights what works and doesn't work on a website. The user perspective is critical as the website is designed for use by users around the world. If aspects of the website do not fit what the user needs/desires, the website has failed to achieve its goal. The UT process is critical at numerous stages of web development, however, when utilized in the early stages of web development, it can lead to a much more successful and robust final product. 

## About the UT Pilot Process
The purpose of the UT pilot process is gain insight into how materials and software used for the UT process function and work with the test subject(s). This process was conducted in person, and recorded using zoom, in order to capture the screen and the facial expressions of the subject
