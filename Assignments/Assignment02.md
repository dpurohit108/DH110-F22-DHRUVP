## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing (UT)

### UN Environment Programme - Site Used for UT

[UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/sustainable-development-goals/why-do-sustainable-development-goals-matter/goal-15) is a site that enables users to discover more about UN environmental programs. The website contains lots of information, however, it can be challenging to navigate and unorganized at times.

Previously in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md), a heuristic evaluation was performed on the site to understand where there were issues with the site. Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) were used in this process. Following this initial evaluation, I addressed several usability concerns that needed to be addressed in order to make the website more user friendly and accessible. These concerns were mostly centered around the function of aspects of the site, how users navigate the site, where certain information was located, and aspects of the aesthetic design as well. As I prepared for the pilot UT, I kept all of these issues in mind in order to see if the issues I recognized challenged other users as well.  

## Purpose of UT 
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to better understand and highlight issues in a website/app's interface. While the heuristic evaluation raises certain issues, the UT can be used to (1) confirm the issues outlined previously and (2) bring to light additional issues and challenges the user may face while attempting to complete certain tasks. The UT also allows for a really good user perspective, which brings up additional issues and highlights what works and doesn't work on a website. The user perspective is critical as the website is designed for use by users around the world. If aspects of the website do not fit what the user needs/desires, the website has failed to achieve its goal. The UT process is critical at numerous stages of web development, however, when utilized in the early stages of web development, it can lead to a much more successful and robust final product. 

## About the UT Pilot Process
The purpose of the UT pilot process is to gain insight into how materials and software used for the UT process function and work with the test subject(s). This process was conducted in person, and recorded using zoom, in order to capture the screen and the facial expressions of the subject. Prior to the session, I created a robust questionnaire which included tasks and additional questions on the user's experience and interactions with the site. 

At the beginning of the session, the user was provided with some background into the questionnaire and the process that they were proceeding with. Following a set of background questions and pre-test questions, the user was presented a set of tasks. Given the issues I highlighted in the heuristic evaluation, the tasks were centered around issues I found through my analysis. They included the following: 

Task 1: Suppose you want to learn about the sustainable development goals and the progress being made to achieve them. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on sustainable development goals
* Locate the colorful boxes that are associated with the goals
* Click on one of the goals to view more details
* Locate the page on measuring progress on the goals

Task 2: Suppose you work for a fossil fuel company and are trying to find out more information on what the UN Environment Programme highlights about chemical pollutants. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on chemicals and pollution action
* Find information on the benefits of chemical control
* Find the main contributors to chemical pollution around the world

Task 3: Suppose you are a researcher and want to obtain details on publications and studies. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on publications & data
* Navigate to the "see more" under publications
* Find publications on the topic of sustainable goals

Task 4: Suppose you want to sign up for the newsletter. 
* Navigate to the page to sign up for the newsletter

Following these tasks, the user was presented with a series of post-test questions. These questions aimed to gauge how easy/difficult the website was for the user and how likely they were to perform certain tasks. The test ended with statements to gauge the user's satisfaction with the website (System Usability Scale and Product Reaction Cards). Lastly, a few demographic questions were asked to the user.
