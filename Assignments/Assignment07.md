## Project Description
The goal of this project is to redesign the current [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website to make it more accessible. The tasks (outlined below) are the main objective of the interactive prototype. The proposed improvements are all included within these tasks and the prototype. 

The purpose of the interactive prototype phase is to implement the interface design and wireflow together to create a functioning model of the proposed website. The interactive prototype brings to life the changes that have been in writing and testing for the last many assignments. By getting feedback on this realistic model of the website, further improvements can be made to make the user experience as seamless as possible. 

## Tasks
The following tasks are supported by this interactive prototype: 
1. Find the list of all the sustainable development goals and find more details on **goal 15** and the goal's challenges & solutions.
2. Find information on practical tips that the user can implement to have a positive impact towards the goals, specifically related to goal 15.
3. Extra: Subsribing to the newsletter to enable the user to stay engaged with the resources of the website.
