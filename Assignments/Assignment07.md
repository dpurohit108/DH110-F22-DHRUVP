# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

Dhruv Purohit | DH110 | Fall 2022

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to redesign the current [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website to make it more accessible. The tasks (outlined below) are the main objective of the interactive prototype. The proposed improvements are all included within these tasks and the prototype. 

The purpose of the interactive prototype phase is to implement the interface design and wireflow together to create a functioning model of the proposed website. The interactive prototype brings to life the changes that have been in writing and testing for the last many assignments. By getting feedback on this realistic model of the website, further improvements can be made to make the user experience as seamless as possible. The process for creating this prototype has come from work in previous assignments relating to interface design and wireflow. Following the prototype creation, feedback will be collected from users.

## Tasks
The following tasks are supported by this interactive prototype: 
1. Find the list of all the sustainable development goals and find more details on **goal 15** and the goal's challenges & solutions.
2. Find information on practical tips that the user can implement to have a positive impact towards the goals, specifically related to goal 15.
3. Extra: Subsribing to the newsletter to enable the user to stay engaged with the resources of the website.

## Cognative Walkthrough (Updated following in class cognative walkthrough)

The following were generalized comments & quotes made by two fellow DH110 students during an in class cognative walk through on Wednesday, November 16th.
The comments and notes recorded using Google Forms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kxph_524VaKWZBmiZiLl0LsLY00k5Ua1Gwj5ecwKFnw/edit).

* "Maybe hamburger menu should be accessible from all pages"
* "Ensure that logo on the top links back to home on all instances"
* "A little confusing why they are all different colors? perhaps all stories can be one kind of blue and the press release can be another shade of blue"
* "I think back buttons would be helpful rather than just going to home"
* "Provide a little more information that your newsletter can show?"
* "Sorry I see there is a back button, this is somewhat unintuitive though"
* "Return to home button does not seem super necessary? at least not on every page because maybe just make the logo a return to home button"
* In reference to Goal 15 Details Page: "These kind of look like buttons that I can click, so it is deceiving that it is not" and "center alignment is a little hard to read, would left align it"
* "The interface does look clean"

## Feedback Summary  & Revisions (Updated following in class cognative walkthrough)

The cognative walkthrough process went smoothly, and both participats agreed that it went smoothly for the most part.
