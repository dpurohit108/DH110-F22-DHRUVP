# [Assignment 08: Project Pitch & Portfolio](https://dpurohit108.github.io/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/)

By: Dhruv Purohit, Digital Humanities 110 - Fall 2022

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to redesign the current [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website to make it more accessible. In doing so, the aim is to make it easier for the user to find relevant information on sustainability in a quick and efficient manner. Currently, the site is difficult to navigate and disorganized. Additionally, information on the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals is difficult to locate with a few clicks. Therefore, one of the main goals is to make it easy for the user to find information on these goals and what they are. The website was evaluated and design changes and decesions were made over the course of 7 assigments in an 8 week period. These assignments highlited the following of analysis and design: 
* Competitor Analysis
* User Research 
* UX Storytelling
* Wireframes & User Interface Design
* Low-Fidelity Prototype
* High-Fidelity Prototype

## Design Statement


## Competitor Analysis

### Heuristic Evaluation

The first step in this project was to choose two websites that fit the theme of the project (UN Sustainable Development Goal 15) and analyze various parts of the site to see is they passed Jacob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). For my analysis, I chose the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/sustainable-development-goals/why-do-sustainable-development-goals-matter/goal-15) website and the [SDG Tracker](https://sdg-tracker.org/biodiversity) website. Each of the ten heuristics were analyzed with respect to the websites and given a severity rating.

</p>

With the [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website (the website chosen for re-design), there were **minor usability problems** (fixes that require low priority) in the following categories: 

1. Visibility of System Status
2. Error Prevention
3. Recognition Rather Than Recall

and **major usability problem** (critical fixes that need high priority) in the following categories: 

1. Match Between System and the Real World
2. Consistency and Standards 
3. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
4. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
5. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
6. Help and Documentation

Overall, the website looked funational at first look, however, when analyzing the 10 heuristics, numerous issues were found, including the overall organization of the website.

Further details on the heristic evluation can be found [here](https://github.com/dpurohit108/DH110-F22-DHRUVP/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment01.md).

### Usability Testing

Following the heuristic analysis and identification of issues on the website, usability testing was used to gain insight from an ideal user to see how they would react to certain tasks and navigate the website. This process was conducted in person, and recorded using zoom, in order to capture the screen and the facial expressions of the subject. For this test, a detailed [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/aDQhmGhYESiUeESB6) was created that would guide the user through background questions, pre-test questions, and four tasks (listed below). The tasks were centered around issues I noted through the heuristic analysis.

Task 1: Suppose you want to learn about the sustainable development goals and the progress being made to achieve them. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on sustainable development goals
* Locate the colorful boxes that are associated with the goals
* Click on one of the goals to view more details
* Locate the page on measuring progress on the goals

Task 2: Suppose you work for a fossil fuel company and are trying to find out more information on what the UN Environment Programme highlights about chemical pollutants. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on chemicals and pollution action
* Find information on the benefits of chemical control
* Find the main contributors to chemical pollution around the world

Task 3: Suppose you are a researcher and want to obtain details on publications and studies. Could you try these tasks?
* Navigate to the page on publications & data
* Navigate to the "see more" under publications
* Find publications on the topic of sustainable goals

Task 4: Suppose you want to sign up for the newsletter. 
* Navigate to the page to sign up for the newsletter

The full usabiltiy test can be found below.

It was found that the issues that I had raised from the heuristic analysis were issues that the user faced while performing the usability testing. While the user was successful at completing a majority of the tasks (and subtasks) listed above, the user pointed out that the **most likely task*** they would complete was **the most difficult and time consuming**. The user was frustrated and somewhat lost at numerous points throughtout the testing process, and brought up specific issues pertaining to: 

* the search bar not working
* menu bar not being fully functional
* the lack of consnsistency
* overll poor design
