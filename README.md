## Introduction
The goal of this project is to redesign the current [UN Environment Programme](https://www.unep.org) website to make it more accessible. In doing so, the aim is to make it easier for the user to find relevant information on sustainability in a quick and efficient manner. Currently, the site is difficult to navigate and disorganized. Additionally, information on the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals is difficult to locate with a few clicks. Therefore, one of the main goals is to make it easy for the user to find information on these goals and what they are. The website was evaluated and design changes and decesions were made over the course of 7 assigments in an 8 week period. These assignments highlited the following of analysis and design: 
* Competitor Analysis
* User Research 
* UX Storytelling
* Wireframes & User Interface Design
* Low-Fidelity Prototype
* High-Fidelity Prototype
